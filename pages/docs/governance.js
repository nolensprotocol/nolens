            Governance at Nolens is about **contribution, not speculation**. We‚Äôre building a system that aligns with those who help ‚Äî not those who hold.

              <p className="text-gray-700 text-base leading-relaxed">
                Most token-voting DAOs reward capital, not contribution. We‚Äôre taking a different path ‚Äî one where high-impact contributors are recognized through action, not accumulation.
                $NOL is non-transferable by design ‚Äî so governance can‚Äôt be bought.

              <p className="text-gray-700 text-base leading-relaxed">
                Every $NOL token represents verifiable contribution. Wallets with more $NOL have demonstrated more help ‚Äî and can earn priority in shaping protocol direction.
                Over time, this will unlock on-chain permissions, access levels, and proposal rights.

              <p className="text-gray-700 text-base leading-relaxed">
                Select contributors may receive soulbound NFTs that serve as governance keys ‚Äî tied to specific domains (design, dev, community). 
                These roles can propose upgrades, vote on expansions, or unlock additional capabilities based on scope and trust.

              <p className="text-gray-700 text-base leading-relaxed">
                Nolens will always favor real work over wealth. We‚Äôll publish proposal rules, maintain open-source logic, and expand governance 
                as contributors grow. Stewards will be elected by reputation ‚Äî and core updates will require multi-sig or community review.
