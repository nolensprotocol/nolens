            Nolens rewards contribution with access — not hype. Here's what $NOL can unlock over time:
          </p>

          <section className="mb-16">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Access NFTs</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 text-base leading-relaxed">
              Use $NOL to mint utility NFTs that represent specific rights or perks — access to events, tools, services, or gated communities.
              These NFTs are tradable and can evolve based on the reputation tied to your $NOL activity.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section className="mb-16">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Contributor Tools</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 text-base leading-relaxed">
              Certain tools and platforms will become unlockable to verified contributors — design assets, dev kits, shared infra, or curated spaces.
              These tools are permissionless to explore, but $NOL gives you *enhanced access or coordination rights*.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section className="mb-16">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Community Utility</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 text-base leading-relaxed">
              Partner communities or creators may offer special access for $NOL holders — including collab drops, co-hosted events, and ecosystem benefits.
              Nolens is designed as a protocol that connects effort with value across ecosystems.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Future Unlocks</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 text-base leading-relaxed">
              In time, $NOL may unlock governance participation, protocol features, or experimental access to shared physical/digital resources.
              We’re just getting started — but the core principle remains: <strong>contribute first, access next</strong>.
