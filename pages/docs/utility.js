            Nolens rewards contribution with access — not hype. Here's what $NOL can unlock over time:

              <p className="text-gray-700 text-base leading-relaxed">
                Use $NOL to mint utility NFTs that represent specific rights or perks — access to events, tools, services, or gated communities.
                These NFTs are tradable and can evolve based on the reputation tied to your $NOL activity.

            <Card className="fade-in-up delay-200">
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">🧩 Contributor Tools</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 text-base leading-relaxed">
                Certain tools and platforms will become unlockable to verified contributors — design assets, dev kits, shared infra, or curated spaces.
                These tools are permissionless to explore, but $NOL gives you <em>enhanced access or coordination rights</em>.

              <p className="text-gray-700 text-base leading-relaxed">
                Partner communities or creators may offer special access for $NOL holders — including collab drops, co-hosted events, and ecosystem benefits.
                Nolens is designed as a protocol that connects effort with value across ecosystems.

                In time, $NOL may unlock governance participation, protocol features, or experimental access to shared physical/digital resources.
                We’re just getting started — but the core principle remains: <strong>contribute first, access next</strong>.
